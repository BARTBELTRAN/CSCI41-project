1.) The very first data structure we used was the dynamic array. We decided to keep this structure because it was suffice for the amount of coding we had, and did not require a more complex data structure. In terms of search complexity for the dynamically allocated array, it would be O(logn) for binary search. In terms of sorting complexity, we decided to do binary search which has a big o notation of O(nlogn). The complexity of traversing through an array is O(n).
The next data structure we decided to keep was the linked list. The main reasoning for choosing this is due to its very fast search complexity of O(1) for the best case. The linked list requires less memory than an array. It also has an insert and delete option. 
The next data structure we decided to keep is the Queue. We picked queue because we want to check the applicants on a first in first out basis. This is the opposite of a stack which is a last in first out. Queue has a search complexity of O(n). 
The last data structure we used was the hash table implemented with a linked list to handle collisions. The linked list keeps the size of the hash table at 8 due to it storing excess data in it as opposed to the hash table. We decided to keep it because it returns specific instances of data implemented with a complexity of O(1) best case and O(n) worst case.
