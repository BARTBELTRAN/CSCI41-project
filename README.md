1.) Affected files include HashTable.cpp, HashTable.h, and menu.h. I implemented the hash table function in Hashtable.h. There, the items are stored in an array of pointers. This array of pointers is very much like having an array of class objects. To combat collisions, I had decided to use linear probing. 

2.) In order to address feedback, I fixed the output of larger numbers by adding commas every three numbers starting from the back. This makes it easier for the user to read the output from the console. I also added a bit more comments to better explain the process the code follows
